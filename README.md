# ThunderbirdAttachmentExtractor
Thunderbird add-on for extracting attachments from e-mails

It does two things:
 1. It saves attachments from selected messages to a folder of your choosing
 2. [Optionally] deletes those attachments from messages
 
Who needs this? 
If your mail server got clogged up and you want to make room but are unwilling to sacrifice your e-mails, Thunderbird allows you to save attachments as separate files and then "delete" them. This has to be done one-by-one.
This add-on enables you to do it in bulk. I would be careful in selecting a lot of messages at once since you might run into resource availability issues (lack of RAM).
